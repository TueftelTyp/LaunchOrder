# LaunchOrder
You know the problem: when booting up, many programs start at the same time, which can slow down the system or lead to conflicts. 
With LaunchOrder, you now have a practical, small open source tool that allows you to easily define the order of the autostart yourself - including freely selectable delays between the programs.

### What LaunchOrder can do:
- Defines an individual launch order for your autostart programs
- Adds delays between launches to conserve resources
- Does not change the Windows autostart entries - full control for you
- Lightweight, easy to use and open source


The tool is ideal for anyone who wants to optimize their PC startup without having to deal with complex settings or scripts.

## Important:
this program does not change the autostarts set by Windows.
If desired, deactivate these before using LaunchOrder.
